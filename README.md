## Online-Art-Gallery
The Online Art Gallery is a web application designed to provide exhibition space for artists to showcase their work and foster connections between artists and the community. This platform maintains a database of art items and supports two primary types of users: patrons and artists. Patrons have the ability to browse all the information on the site, add reviews and "likes" to artwork, "follow" artists, and participate in workshops. Artists, on the other hand, can add new artwork to the gallery and host workshops to engage with the community.

# Run Instructions
- In a terminal, navigate to the directory where all the source files are saved.
- Once in that directory, running "npm install" in the terminal will install all dependencies needed.
- Running "node server.js" will then start the server.
- In any browser, visit "http://localhost:3000/" (in the url bar) to access the web page.
